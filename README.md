# Hello World!!
My name is ZediWards

###
This master branch is where my Pelican output directory will reside.

The source code "the rest of the Pelican file tree" with be held within the "source" branch.

4-30-2018:
- Pushing a mock file tree of what my static blog will be. Testing out placement of my output folder and .gitignore file.

- Used gitHubs Python .gitignore template. The only thing I added to it was develop_server.sh

- I have not messed with ignoring output folder and putting it into the master branch yet (everything is in the master branch)
