# Hello World!!
My name is ZediWards

###
This branch "source" will be where my source code for my website will reside. The master branch will house my output dir that is needed to serve the static html file for the website.

####
I will include a .gitignore file within the source dir that will include the output dir.

#####
Theoretical workflow for now:
- I will write articles locally within the content directory.
- To publish: I will update the output directory via pelican commands (pelican content -s publishconf.py)
  - Then push source code to source branch & output directory to master branch.
